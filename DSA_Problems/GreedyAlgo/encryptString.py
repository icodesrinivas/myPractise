Encrypt the string - 2

You are given a string S. Every sub-string of identical letters is replaced by a single instance of that letter followed by the hexadecimal representation of the number of occurrences of that letter. Then, the string thus obtained is further encrypted by reversing it [ See the sample for more clarity ]. Print the Encrypted String.

Note: All Hexadecimal letters should be converted to Lowercase letters.

Input:
S = "abc"
Output:
1c1b1a
Explanation:
abc
Step1: a1b1c1
Step2: 1c1b1a [After reversing]
